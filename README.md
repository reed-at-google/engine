Flutter Engine
==============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flutter/engine.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/flutter/engine)

Flutter is a new way to build high-performance, cross-platform mobile apps.
Flutter is optimized for today's, and tomorrow's, mobile devices. We are
focused on low-latency input and high frame rates on Android and iOS.

The Flutter Engine is the runtime environment for hosting Flutter applications.
Most developers will interact with Flutter via the Flutter Framework and APIs,
which run inside the engine.

_Flutter is still under development and we continue to add 
features._ However, it is ready for use by early adopters who are willing to deal
with the odd wrinkle or two along the way.  We hope you try it out and send
us [feedback](mailto:flutter-dev@googlegroups.com).
